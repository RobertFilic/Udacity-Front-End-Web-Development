Your response goes here!
These are my reflections:
1. I improved my HTML skills and can better search the web to find support when looking for new HTML tags.
2. The course is very clear and easy to follow. HTML is not that difficult by itself, however requires understanding the syntax and object names
3. It is challenging to know and find appropriate HTML objects
4. Searching became easier and i'm using development tools to help me out understand existing syntaxes.
